TO - DO (updated 26/07/22 12:17pm)

Easy
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Add headers to file output, add them on the _init_ 
- Have the 'Break' image appear at the end of each block for ~60s followed by the 'Trigger' image
- Remove the black screen between trials so that the order is: background-person-correct/incorrect slide-background....etc... 
- Figure out why shock was not working

=======
- Have the 'Break' image appear at the end of each block for ~60s followed by the 'Trigger' image 
	Better to leave the time up to the trigger rather than a constraint, people wont get really tired during the session.

Develop
- Keyboard version of the experiment (with all the images) - all the images? thought that it was a reduced version of it////
	Two versions portable and with dependencies is possible...
	
- Trigger switch version of the experiment only needs two different 'Go' and 'NoGo' images and three of the background images
	got lost here in terms of what is needed for what version.....

- Statistics at the end of each block (only if not too tedious)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Classifier, repit test if under x miliseconds, probably a key legacy.


Difficult?
- Write code that allows participants to click a hyperlink in an email to auto download the open source python software and install it on their computer to make it easy for them to do the keyboard version of the experiment at home.
=======
	stats function at the end...

- There is a problem, images need to be converted, otherwise error while loading, possible solution? ==
