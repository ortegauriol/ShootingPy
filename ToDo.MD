TO - DO (updated 26/07/22 12:17pm)

Easy
- Add headers to file output, add them on the _init_ 
- Have the 'Break' image appear at the end of each block for ~60s followed by the 'Trigger' image 

Develop
- Keyboard version of the experiment (with all the images)
- Trigger switch version of the experiment only needs two different 'Go' and 'NoGo' images and three of the background images
- Statistics at the end of each block (only if not too tedious)
- Classifier, repit test if under x miliseconds, probably a key legacy.


Difficult?
- Write code that allows participants to click a hyperlink in an email to auto download the open source python software and install it on their computer to make it easy for them to do the keyboard version of the experiment at home.
