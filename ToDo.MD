TO - DO (updated 02/08/22 11:30am)

Easy
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Add headers to file output, add them on the _init_ 
- Have the 'Break' image appear at the end of each block for ~60s followed by the 'Trigger' image
- Remove the black screen between trials so that the order is: background-person-correct/incorrect slide-background....etc... 
- Figure out why shock was not working

Develop
>>Spoke to Arne. Agreed that keyboard version should have reduced number of images. 3 background, L & R pistol, L & R rifle, L & R phone, L & R keys.
>> Trigger switch version has all the images (as it was originally designed).
- Keyboard version of the experiment (with all the images) - all the images? thought that it was a reduced version of it////
	Two versions portable and with dependencies is possible...


- Statistics at the end of each block (only if not too tedious)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Classifier, repit test if under x miliseconds, probably a key legacy.


Difficult?
- Write code that allows participants to click a hyperlink in an email to auto download the open source python software and install it on their computer to make it easy for them to do the keyboard version of the experiment at home.

	stats function at the end...

- There is a problem, images need to be converted, otherwise error while loading, possible solution? ==
